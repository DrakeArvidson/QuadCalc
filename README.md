QuadCalc
========
A simple Java application I created before I graduated from school.  I wanted to create something that meant something to me, with my Mathematics
Minor I decided to created a Quadratic Formula calculator.  This is a Java Project that can be pulled right into Eclipse or other IDE and run.
